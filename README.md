# MIPS_Programs
This is a repository for some programs I've written in MIPS. MIPS is the name of an Instruction Set Architecture and the language used to program in said architecture. I used the MARS IDE to write and run these programs. They are not very large or complicated, they're meant to showcase relatively simple algorithms in the MIPS language.
