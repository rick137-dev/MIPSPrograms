# MIPS Programs

This repository contains a collection of small programs written in **MIPS assembly language**, showcasing classic algorithms and simple problem-solving techniques.  
All programs were developed and tested using the [MARS IDE](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/).

The purpose of this repo is to provide clear and concise examples of how fundamental algorithms can be implemented at the assembly level.  
These programs are great for students, hobbyists, or anyone interested in understanding how higher-level logic translates into low-level instructions.
